- Preliminary Project - FeupEvac

## FeupEvac - Proposal Submission
Our project FeupEvac will be a platformer (Theme #1) with some horizontal scroll levels. 

It will consist on a destroyed FEUPâ€™s library that we need to get out because itâ€™s crumbling. There will be terrorists trying to kill us, that we will fight to get out alive with some power ups:
- A computer mouse (for a whip like attack),
- Limited usb pens for a long range attack,
- And maybe others.. 

There will be falling/moving platforms such as the floor and book shelves.

We would like to develop in Unity 2D.

The main challenges that we have identified will be making sprites and animations, and creating multiple types of enemies with some sort of difficulty increase in them.
